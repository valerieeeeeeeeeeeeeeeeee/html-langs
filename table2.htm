                    Charles Babbage was born on December 26, 1791, the son of Benjamin Babbage, a London banker. 
                    
                    In 1821 Babbage invented the Difference Engine to compile mathematical tables. 
                    On completing it in 1832, he conceived the idea of a better machine that could perform not just one mathematical task but 
                    any kind of calculation. This was the Analytical Engine (1856), which was intended as a general symbol manipulator, 
                    and had some of the characteristics of today’s computers.</th>

                <th colspan="2" style="font-size: larger; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"> In 1931, Turing began attending King’s College (University of Cambridge), a progressive new home that both fostered 
                    his scientific curiosities and helped further define his homosexual identity. 
                    This hypothetical singular machine could theoretically compute anything computable or solve any well-defined task when given a 
                    set of pre-defined rules or instructions. Impossible to build, his proposed device laid the groundwork for modern computers, 
                    earning Turing the posthumous title, “the father of modern computer science.”
